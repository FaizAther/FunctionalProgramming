q1)
  Write two non-trivial quick checks for each function from the Stack coding problem.

  Non-trivial means do not do tests on only Empty or the unary Stack x. For instance, some trivial tests on stackMap would be

  quickCheck $ \ xs -> stackMap _ Empty = Empty
  quickCheck $ \ xs -> stackMap f (Stack Empty 1) = (Stack Empty (f 1)) 

  Each is two points.

    1.    stackFoldl
    2.    stackFoldr
    3.    stackZip
    4.    stackMap
