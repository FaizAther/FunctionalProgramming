q1)
  Write two non-trivial quick checks for each function from the Stack coding problem.

  Non-trivial means do not do tests on only Empty or the unary Stack x. For instance, some trivial tests on stackMap would be

  quickCheck $ \ xs -> stackMap _ Empty = Empty
  quickCheck $ \ xs -> stackMap f (Stack Empty 1) = (Stack Empty (f 1)) 

  Each is two points.

    1.    stackFoldl
    2.    stackFoldr
    3.    stackZip
    4.    stackMap
q2)
  Write two unit tests for each function from the Stack coding problem.

  Your tests should include: i. An edge case. ii. A generic case.

  Each is two points...

    1.    stackFoldl
    2.    stackFoldr
    3.    stackZip
    4.    stackMap
q3)
  Write two unit tests and two quick checks for maxPath.

  For each test, breifly explain why you chose that test.
