A Stack is a data structure typically used for first in, last out (FILO) 

Consider the following data constructor...
    data Stack a = Empty | Stack (Stack a) a deriving Show

You task is to implement some of the typical higher-order-function for this
list.

**DO NOT** just convert to a list and convert back.

=======
EXAMPLE
=======

> as = Empty
> bs = Stack as 1
> cs = Stack bs 2
> xs = Stack cs 3
> ys = Stack xs 4
> zs = Stack ys 5

> stackFoldl (*) 6 zs
720

> stackFoldl (^) 0 xs
9

> stackFoldr (*) 6 zs
720

> stackFoldr (^) 0 xs


> stackMap (2*) zs
Stack (Stack (Stack (Stack (Stack Empty 2) 4) 6) 8) 10

> ks = stackMap (2*) zs
> stackZip xs ks-- as with built-in zip, truncate the longer stack.
Stack (Stack (Stack Empty (1,6)) (2,8)) (3,10)

NOTE:  Passing these tests ONLY is DEFINITELY insufficient to conclude your code
is correct.  For instance, the folding examples use a commutative operator and 
thus do not actually distinguishing between left and right folding.

Part of this assessment is producing tests for your own code.  Indeed your
written submission is asking for some tests.
